  <h1>Barbara Baird</h1>
  <p>I am a Web Designer from the Austin TX area.  I am currently a senior at the University of Maryland University College studying Digital Media/ Web Technology.  I have been interested in web design for about 10 years, but never really had the chance to learn how to design sites.  In 2014 I was given the opportunity to go back to college, I knew immediately what I wanted to study- Web Design.  I love the challenge of taking an idea and making a web page from it. <br/><br/> 

I am a wife and mother of 2.  This year my husband and I will celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary.  We have 2 daughters who keep us very busy.  I love arts and crafts; mostly I do rubber-stamping and scrapbooking, but I will try just about anything.  I think all of my years of crafting have really helped me as a web designer.  As a crafter I have learned to work with color, typography, and arranging images; all of these are important skills to have as a web designer.  My husband and I are both very involved at our church.  One of my friends and I just started a branch of the Women’s Ministry. Created to Create was born out of our love of crafting and learning how to use that talent to serve others around us.  I also serve on the Audio/Video team making sure that all the slides and videos run smoothly for service.
