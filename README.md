# BB Design
This is the portfolio site I designed for myself. 
This site was designed as the final project for my Current Trends and Projects in
Digital Media and Web Technology class in the Summer of 2016. 
I used HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to design this site. 
For the contact form I used www.jotforms.com. 
All of the photographs on this site were taken my Cheri Thompson at www.cthompsonphotog.com. 
I used Adobe Photoshop to edit the photographs, as needed. 
Adobe Illustrator was used in designing my logo and for other designs on the site. 
This site is the first site that is truly my own, there were no design elements 
that I had to add to satisfy a class requirement. 
Since this site is my portfolio site I wanted all of the pictures used to be unique to me, 
so I had Cheri take pictures of my work area. I used these pictures as the background for the home page, 
the header of each page and the background for the contact form. 
When designing this site I was able to let my personality show,
It was great being able to design a site for myself.
